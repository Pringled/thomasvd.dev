## Summary

Head of AI Engineering at Springer Nature, where I lead a team building AI-driven solutions that improve scientific publishing. I specialize in recommender systems, information retrieval, and building practical ML systems that scale. 

Co-founder of [Minish](https://github.com/MinishLab), an open-source ML lab focused on efficient, eco-friendly models. Creator of Model2Vec, SemHash, Vicinity, and the Potion embedding models.

## Experience

**Springer Nature** — Head of AI Engineering  
*Dec 2024 - Present • Groningen, Netherlands*

Leading a team of engineers building AI-driven solutions for scientific publishing. Currently working on research discovery tools, compliance screening systems, and driving the adoption of generative AI across the organization. Responsible for team growth, technical strategy, and bringing ML products from research to production.

**Springer Nature** — Senior Machine Learning Engineer  
*Oct 2023 - Dec 2024 • Groningen*

The Slimmer AI science division was acquired by Springer Nature after successfully working on ML products together for a number of years. I continued my role as technical lead of the recommenders team.

**Minish** — Co-founder  
*Sep 2024 - Present (part-time) • Groningen, Netherlands*

Developing open-source ML software with a focus on efficiency and eco-friendly models. Our GitHub org: [MinishLab](https://github.com/MinishLab).

We are currently working on the following open-source projects:
- Model2Vec: Fast State-of-the-Art Static Embeddings
- Vicinity: Lightweight Nearest Neighbors with Flexible Backends
- SemHash: Fast Semantic Text Deduplication
- Potion models: State-of-the-art Static Embedding Models

**Slimmer AI** — Machine Learning Engineer  
*May 2021 - Oct 2023 • Groningen*

Worked as a machine learning engineer and tech lead of the recommenders team, developing ML products in the scientific domain.

**Gronalytica** — Co-founder  
*Jun 2019 - May 2021 • Groningen, Netherlands*

Developed a platform for automatic grading of pharmaceutical exams at pharmagrader.com. Funded by SNN.

**iChoice4U BV** — Data Scientist  
*Dec 2017 - May 2019 • UMCG, Groningen*

Worked as a data scientist/research assistant on data from Pscribe.

## Education

**University of Groningen** — Master's degree, Artificial Intelligence  
*2018 - 2020*

Graduated cum laude (9.5 thesis, 8.4 average grade).  
Thesis title: "Quality Prediction of Scientific Documents Using Textual and Visual Content"

**University of Groningen** — Bachelor's degree, Information Science  
*2015 - 2018*

## Open Source Projects

- **[Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec)** — A distillation framework for creating state-of-the-art static embeddings from Sentence Transformers. Encodes up to 20k embeddings/s on CPU with a 10% MTEB improvement over prior static embedding baselines.

- **[SemHash](https://github.com/MinishLab/semhash)** — A package for semantic deduplication and filtering or large datasets baed on embedding similarity. Can be used to remove near-duplicates, detect overlap between splits, or clean large corpora before training.

- **[Pyversity](https://github.com/MinishLab/pyversity)** — A unified interface for optimized diversity algorithms in Python, designed for improving search & retrieval results. 

- **[Potion models](https://huggingface.co/collections/minishlab/potion)** — Tiny state-of-the-art static embedding models. Pre-trained models include English, Multilingual, and retrieval models.

- **[Vicinity](https://github.com/MinishLab/vicinity)** — A unified ANN interface for many ANN algorithms that includes evaluation tools.
