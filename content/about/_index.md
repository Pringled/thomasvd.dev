I'm a machine learning engineer based in Groningen, Netherlands, where I lead AI engineering at Springer Nature and co-founded Minish, an open-source ML lab. If you want to get in touch, feel free to [reach out via email or social links](#get-in-touch).

## Beyond Work

When I'm not building ML systems, you'll find me:

- Playing guitar (mostly rock, blues and country, but recently getting into jazz)
- Competing in powerlifting ([competition history](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/thomasvandongen))
- Hanging out with Elvis (my standard poodle)
- Reading books (mostly fantasy), listening to music (almost any genre), and watching movies
- Gaming; I used to play a lot of multiplayer games (some of my favorites include WoW, CSGO, and Guild Wars 2), but nowadays I mostly play single-player titles due to time constraints. I'm a huge fan of everything FromSoftware makes; Bloodborne is (probably) my favorite game of all time.
- Cooking (mostly Italian)
